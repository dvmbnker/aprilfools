                        <p> Okay, so we both know you "had a life" before you met me, so I guess I have to address that too, don't i (ugh). But no seriously, look at the hairrrrrr, you looked so adorable. You still have that smile. A bit more sophisticated I guess but the same amount of naughtiness. I love it. This is where your story began. From Klemzig and Mudra Dance academy and lets be honest, regardless of what you might say, this is where you began to shape into the strong, confident woman you are (i am not using profanity incase you wanna show our kids one day). But no seriously, super cute and still confident. This is only stage 1.  </p>

                        <h2>Pari - Stage 2</h2>
                        <p>This is where you shined in my life. When you managed to take control of another life without doing anything besides be yourself. Satche Pari. What the hell, you were just yourself and somehow took control of me. Ik i've probably told this story before, but this is a recap so lets recap anyway. You and I had to sit next to each other to work on the Park (yk) and after like 3 conversations I was like damn, I have a crush on her don't I. What'd you do? Be yourself. But the way u talked was so adorable yar. The way you said "Sh!t", omg so cute. Ayo, I just realised, you started swearing before me, so come down the pedestool next to me. But even if this part of your life was just a blip, this is easily the biggest deviation that's happen to my life and the most impact I had from your life and I love it. Stage 2 was you becoming a teenager but still being as adorable as ever. Trash at handball though, I had to save you so many times and now I think about it, I got out to you so many times purely cause I wanted to help you. Ugh...witch with a B. </p>

                        <p> This stage of your life is where I think I was the most detached from. Like lets be real, you were your own person and becoming the person you are today, all by yourself and frrom what I remember we didn't really talk at all. Idk if that's good or bad, but I have no regrets because I know you loved Year 9 and I am happy that you got to live that. So I don't have a lot to say. This is the stage of your life when I said "Look in the mirror" and got a bit awkward between us but I will say, I still heard things about you. Still saw you at Garba and damn, every time I'd see you, I'd realise that there's no one like you on this planet. That's cliche ik, but its also very true. Cause who's like you Pari? The most confident woman I've ever seen. I remember being petrified to talk to you, but when we did, gah damn, I was so happy cause you are amazing. You always have been. You stole my bottle at Garba and idek what happen after that, but thats my fav memory from any of the garbas in this part of my life. Btw, Jenil's a ####head. On his bday, he made you do a dare where you had to say the bad things about each person and I think you said, my clothes were too dark. LMAOOOOO. Years later, you still think the same. Its cute. I love how stubborn you are. But yeah, this stage of your life was you figuring everything out by urself and honestly, I can see how this part of life is arguably the most important yet, cause u fell in love with nature, shakha took over and started becoming so competitive with academics, however that's always been you but again, that was one of our most used topic of conversations so it was definetly more prominent. </p>

                        <h2>Pari Stage 4 ( my fav) </h2>
                        <p> This is a bit of fuzzy line when this stage happen. But I'd say this is around year 11+, this is when we reconnected and I am so grateful for this stage. This is where you starting becoming a young adult simultaneously being a baby. You helped me the most in this stage of your life even if you don't realise. This is where Pari (grew a brain and) decided that Devam was a green flag and maybe it'd be okay to actually date him. Glad that it happened. To be honest, I know a lot must've happen in your life but I hope you don't disagree, but this is when you and I became good friends and eventually became each other's comfort space. Not home, not the entire stage. But we definetly talked, vented and yapped about grades all the to family with a little bit of flirting here and there. This is where you and I became so good a friends that I started to see my life with you again (after 2 years of getting over you, ugh) but I am not complaining cause this is when Pari started to see me the same way. This is also when I saw how much of hardworker Pari is. Ik year 12 was always gonna be great for you, but I was able to see how much you needed to prove people wrong and prove that you're capable to beat whoever they underestimate you with and yeah, it was amazing to see you triumph and I am glad that you decided to make me enough part of your life where you let me in and see you beat every person that was compared to you. This is easily the stage where I learnt about Pari the most cause I saw how ambition she is and saw how "innocent" she really is. *cough cough* "Come Over" message every week until I said "Okay". So yeah, this is where I learnt about Pari the most and saw her become an adult from the girl that I liked in Primary school. And I am so grateful that I got to be there for nearly all of it. I love you Pari, imma say it everytime I think it, cause you deserve to be loved for who you are.  </p>

                        <p>This is where we are. And I don't have a lot that I haven't said. You've moved away and even though its not ideal but I think this is the most i've seen you grow. From hating it to loving it and I am glad that you found your people. This is where I've seen you grow and yeah change cause change is inevitable but change for the better. I am just glad that after 3 years of dating and 10 years of being together, I am still able to sit and watch you grow. LDR has helped you and me grow to the people that we are and even though it sucks, its a lesson of appreciation that we've learnt so I am glad.</p>
